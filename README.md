Implementation of the Glicko-2 algorithm in Racket.

## What is Glicko-2?

Glicko-2 is an algorithm for assessing the skill of a player/team relative to the skills of other players/teams in its domain, taking into account variables such as past relative skill, most recent performances, rating periods and consistency. It can also be described as an enhancement from the ELO metric, ubiquitious and bred in the Chess community.

Full detail of the concrete algorithm used to calculate Glicko-2 ratings can be foudn in the following [article](https://www.glicko.net/glicko/glicko2.pdf) by its creator, Mark Glickman.
