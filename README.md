## What is Glicko-2?

Glicko-2 is an algorithm for assessing the skill of a player/team relative to the skills of other players/teams in its domain, taking into account variables such as past relative skill, most recent performances, rating periods and consistency. It can also be described as an enhancement from the ELO metric, ubiquitious and bred in the Chess community.
